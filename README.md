# Random Forest Classifier for Cyberattack Detection

---

## Project Overview

This notebook builds a Random Forest classifier to identify network intrusions based on labeled traffic features. The analysis covers preprocessing, handling missing values, model training, performance evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

---

## Objectives

* Clean and prepare a cybersecurity dataset for model training
* Encode categorical variables and impute missing values
* Train and evaluate a Random Forest model
* Analyze which features are most influential for classification

---

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing

* **Missing Value Handling**: Applied mean imputation by grouping entries according to attack type to retain class-specific characteristics.
* **Encoding Categorical Features**:

  * Applied One-Hot Encoding to the `protocol_type` feature to transform it into a machine-readable format.
* **Final Inspection**: Verified data consistency before model fitting.

### 2. Model Training

* Used `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn.
* Training performed on a 70:30 train-test split.
* Visualized sample decision trees to better understand model structure.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

* Explored:

  * `n_estimators`: Number of decision trees in the forest
  * Additional model hyperparameters can be incorporated in future iterations

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy on training and test datasets
* Confusion matrix and classification report
* Feature importance ranking for model interpretability

## Key Insights

* Attack-type-based imputation enhanced representation of minority classes.
* Random Forest effectively handled high-dimensional data and class separability.
* Most influential features were identified, offering interpretability to model decisions.
* The approach can be used as a foundation for real-world intrusion detection systems.

## Tools and Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
* **Matplotlib**, **Graphviz** for visualization

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the use of ensemble learning in cybersecurity applications. The combination of proper preprocessing and model tuning enabled the construction of a reliable classifier for identifying network threats based on structured feature data.
